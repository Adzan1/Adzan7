<h1>Megathrust.</h1>
<p>Megathrust Explanation.
A megathrust is a large earthquake that happens when two tectonic plates meet in a subduction zone, where one plate is forced beneath the other. These earthquakes are the most powerful on Earth, with moment magnitudes that can exceed 9.0. 
Megathrust earthquakes often cause tsunamis that can be more destructive than the earthquakes themselves. This is because the earthquakes can cause the sea floor to move abruptly over a large area, which can generate tsunamis. Teletsunamis can cross ocean basins and devastate areas far from the original earthquake. 
Some examples of subduction zones where megathrust earthquakes occur include: 
The Sumatra and Java trenches 
The Nankai Trough 
The Peruâ€“Chile Trench 
The Cascadia Subduction Zone, which includes the coasts of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and Northern California </p>
