<h1>Megathrust Explanation.</h1>
<p> A megathrust is a large earthquake that happens when two tectonic plates meet in a subduction zone, where one plate is forced beneath the other. These earthquakes are the most powerful on Earth, with moment magnitudes that can exceed 9.0. 
Megathrust earthquakes often cause tsunamis that can be more destructive than the earthquakes themselves. This is because the earthquakes can cause the sea floor to move abruptly over a large area, which can generate tsunamis. Teletsunamis can cross ocean basins and devastate areas far from the original earthquake. 
Some examples of subduction zones where megathrust earthquakes occur include: 
The Sumatra and Java trenches 
The Nankai Trough 
The Peruâ€“Chile Trench 
The Cascadia Subduction Zone, which includes the coasts of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and Northern California </p>

<h1>Inventor Who Regrets That His Invention Made the World Chaotic</h1>
<p> Quoted from www.cnbcindonesia.com      1. J. Robert Oppenheimer.
The father of the atomic bomb became the leader of the Manhattan Project, a US military initiative to create a powerful weapon. Oppenheimer developed his first nuclear weapons in a secret lab located at Los Alamos.

This bomb was used in the bombing of two cities in Japan, namely Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Later, he regretted his discovery because it resulted in mass deaths. Oppenheimer quoted a sentence from the Bhagavad Gita which says 'Now I am death, the destroyer of worlds'.

2. Alfred Bernhard Nobel
Alfred Nobel's name was the first to inspire the Nobel Peace Prize. The award was created to make up for his regrets about dynamite, which he invented in 1860.

According to The Ten Tops page, Nobel actually created dynamite to help his family's mining business. Apparently, this weapon was used to kill other people in various wars.

3. Mikhail Kalashnikov 
He was the inventor of the AK-47 weapon in 1947. This weapon is widely used in the world because it is cheap and easy to produce.

It seems Kalashnikov knew the AK-47 was being used for bad things. Because in his letter to the Russian Orthodox Church before he died, he questioned whether he was wrong after the weapon he created apparently took another person's life.</p>
